This project is a backend-based web application that integrates third-party APIs to retrieve, process, and display data in a clean and user-friendly way.
All external API requests are handled strictly on the server side to ensure security and proper backend architecture

The application fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API and provides additional functionality by integrating a News API to display relevant news based on the selected city
